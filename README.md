Thermostat Challenge   		        
=================


Synopsis:
-------

Thermostat challenge required us to create a system for a thermostat which can increase/decrease the temperature. A power saving feature was also implimented which had an influence on how high the temperature can go when turned on. I carried out test-driven development to ensure that there were no errors in the system.

Features:
-------

```sh
* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temp with the up button
* You can decrease the temp with the down button
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default
* You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting the reset button
```


Technologies Used
------

* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Jasmine
